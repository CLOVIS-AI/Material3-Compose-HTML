Blackbox implementation of the [Material3](https://m3.material.io/) specification for [Compose HTML](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#compose-html).

> This library is currently at early stages of development.

## Why?

The [official Material3 library](https://github.com/material-components/material-web) is not made for Compose HTML, lacks many animations, and is [not maintained anymore](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/5642).

We decided to create our own alternative implementation that is custom-built for Kotlin.

## Design tokens

This library implements all Material3 color [design tokens](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview) as CSS variables, making them easy to use inside components.

To import them in your project, see [the documentation](https://opensavvy.gitlab.io/ui/compose-material3-html/api-docs/theme/index.html).
